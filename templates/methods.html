          <h2 style="color:#B9B1B1">1. Collection and Cleaning </h2>
          <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">Valve (Dota2 Publisher) provides a strong Web API for developers to fetch both match and player data. For this
            project, we built a local python script which calls the Dota2 Web API and save each results into a local file.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">However, there are lot of factors that would affect the data set that we expected. Therefore, We filtered out the
            invalid and inappropiate data during our collection.</p>
          <h5 style="color:#B9B1B1">1.1 Invalid Matches</h5>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">The match details we fetched with the Web API include every single match generated (not completed). Therefore,
            there are quite a lot matches with absent players, little match duration or zero skills and item build. We identified
            these matches as invalid matches during our collection process, and added arguments to detect invalid matches.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">In addition to invalid games, we also encountered a lot of private matches, which are mostly practice matches (does
            not count for win or lose) and local matches which we have no access to. We also filtered out these matches.</p>

          <h5 style="color:#B9B1B1">1.2 Match Modes</h5>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">There are currently 23 modes of game in Dota2. However, not all of them are typical. For example, only two players
            play against each other in the "Mid Only" mode, which cannot fit into our data. In addition, entertaining modes
            like "Ability Draft" or "All Random Death Match" can also negatively affect our data set.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">Therefore the final 7 modes we selected is:</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">·
            <b>All Pick </b>: Players can select any hero from a pool of 115 heros.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">·
            <b>Ranked All Pick </b>: Ranked Matches. Players can select any hero from a pool of 115 heros.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">·
            <b>Captain’s Mode </b>: The most common mode used in professional matches. Each team would have a captain. Two teams
            ban and pick heros from a pool of 115 heros with a specific order.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">·
            <b>Random Draft </b>: Each player can select a hero from from a pool of 50 random heros. </p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">·
            <b>Captains Draft </b>: Similar to Captain's Mode. But with a pool of 50 random heros.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">·
            <b>Single Draft </b>: Players will be given 3 heros randomly. They can only choose one hero from the three.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">·
            <b>All Random </b>: Each player will be randomly assigned a hero. They can have only one chance to re-random.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">These seven modes are the most common and typical game modes in Dota2, which we believe can be used safely to be
            combined into our data set. </p>

            <h2 style="color:#B9B1B1">2. Feature Vector </h2>

            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">DotA2 has a player matching mechanism that will automatically match the players with similar competition level
              (also called “matchmaking ranking”) together in a match. By assuming every player in a match can play the game
              equally well, we can simplify our prediction for the match result by solely focusing on hero selection (the
              role each player chooses in a match). More specifically, our analysis aims to capture the effect of the following
              three types of input on the match outcome: which heroes are playing in a given match, which heroes are being
              played together as a lineup of five, and which lineup of five opposing heroes they are competing against. </p>
            <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">Under such assumption, we designed our feature vector as follows: since there are 120 heroes in total in DotA2
              and we want to distinguish hero selection on either the “Radiant” or “Dire” side, the input feature vector
              is constructed as a binary vector x ∈ R (120x2) encoding the presence or absence of a hero in the match. The
              first half of the feature vector (X1 ...X120) represents the Radiant side and the second half (X121…X240) represents
              the Dire side. More specifically, the first half of the feature vector is constructed as follows:</p>
            <img src="img/m1.png">
            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">Similarly, the second half of the feature vector is constructed as follows: </p>
            <img src="img/m2.png">

            <h2 style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">3. Models </h2>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">Drawing on existing literature of sports analytics, we experimented with two machine learning models for predicting
              DotA2 match outcomes: Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. We finally decided to use Neural Networks because
              it has been shown to be most effective at our prediction task.</p>
            <h5 style="color:#B9B1B1">3.1 Logistic Regression</h5>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">After randomly splitting the entire dataset (65,921 matches) into training (46,144 matches) and test dataset
              (19,777 matches), we first tried logistic regression model on the training data and followed up with 10-fold
              cross validation to check if the result holds up more precisely. The logistic regression model aims to minimize
              the following cost function:</p>
            <img style="width:100%;" src="img/m3.png">
            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">The model accuracy on the test data is around 59.1%. This is further affirmed by an accuracy of 59.3% obtained
              through 10-fold cross validation. However, a test error of 41% is not sufficient for our prediction task. We
              therefore proceeded to experiment with the Neural Network model.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:#B9B1B1">3.2 Neural Networks</h5>

            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">We experimented with different configurations of neural networks to find the optimal approach. For our purpose,
              the most successful neural net used three layers, 12 and 6 neurons in the first two layers with the rectifier
              (‘relu’) activation function and the sigmoid function on the output layer. Relu has been commonly used as an
              activation function because it performed better than sigmoid activation functions in deep NNs (Glorot, Bordes,
              and Bengio, 2011). Sigmoid function is used to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map
              to either the Radiant or the Dire class. The network architecture is shown below.
            </p>
            <img style="width:100%;" src="img/m4.png">
            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">After training the model for 150 epochs, our neural network successfully achieved an accuracy of 73% on test
              data. The train and test accuracy for all 150 epochs is plotted in the chart below. We can see that the model
              is showing comparable skills on both the train and test data, indicating that our neural net has not overfit
              the data.

            <h2 style="color:#B9B1B1">4. Improvements </h2>

            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">Currently, the model we built can help us predicting the winning side of a game before the game starts. However,
              we would like to build a more powerful model that can predict the winning side during a match in real-time,
              which can also take player's level into account. There are several factors that we need to take into account
              to improve our model.</p>

            <h5 style="color:#B9B1B1">4.1 Player Data </h5>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">For the current model we built, we are assuming that each player in a match is playing equally (with the same
              abilities to play any hero). However, in real world matches, player's ability to play each hero varies. For
              example, one plays quite good at Anitimage will probably perform poorly playing Lion. The positions and heros
              a player is good at should therefore be taken into consideration to analyze the result of a match.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top:-8px;color:#B9B1B1">
              For our future study, we expect to take the player's past hero experience into account when building our model, so the model
              could more accurately predict the winning side.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:#B9B1B1">4.2 Items and Skills</h5>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1">Items and skills are also the key factors that can influnce win or lose. For example, the wrong item build on
              a specific hero might be the main reason of losing the game. Therefore, we hope that through item and skill
              analysis, we could reduce the impact of hero drafts on the final results. Or in other words, the draft should not be used to predict the winning side alone.
            </p>

            <h5 style="color:#B9B1B1">4.3 Gamification</h5>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;color:#B9B1B1"> To achieve real-time prediction, we would like to gamify the prediction process. For example, we would like to
              use the Dota2 map as the background and monitor the match through hero icons moving over the map.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;color:#B9B1B1"> This process would require that our model should take the item and skill as both factors and outputs. Therefore,
              gamification is our ultimate goal for Dota2 prediction.
            </p>
